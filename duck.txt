#if you want the configuration for a different domain, use the drop down box above
#you can pass a comma separated (no spaces) list of domains
#you can if you need to hard code an IP (best not to - leave it blank and we detect your remote ip)
#hit ESC then use use arrow keys to move the cursor x deletes, i puts you back into insert mode

#now save the file (CTRL+o then CTRL+x)
#lets test the script

./duck.sh

#this should simply return to a prompt
#we can also see if the last attempt was successful (OK or bad KO)

cat duck.log

#if it is KO check your Token and Domain are correct in the duck.sh script
#The final task for Raspbmc is to make the cron autostart on reboot for Raspbian you don't need to do this
#first we simply manualy start the crontab
